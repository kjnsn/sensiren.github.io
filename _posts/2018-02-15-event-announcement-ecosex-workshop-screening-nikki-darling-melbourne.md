<p style="margin:0;padding:10px0px0px;color:rgb(102,106,115);">A growing movement of ecosexuals think so! Join sexuality educator Siren Vandoll in a discussion about how engaging with the Earth as a lover can change our relationship with nature, ownership, art, politics, activism and sustainability. This workshop will explore the spectrum of ecosexual expression including its physical, emotional and spiritual manifestations, as well as examining the various intersections with areas like feminism, anti-colonialism and animal welfare/veganism. This workshop does not require any existing knowledge.</p>
