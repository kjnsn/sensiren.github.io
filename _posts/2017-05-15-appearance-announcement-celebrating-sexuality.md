I am so proud and excited to announce that I will be joining some amazing presenters to bring two of my most popular workshops to <a href="http://www.celebratingsexuality.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrating Sexuality</a> from November 17th to 19th, 2017!

From the CS website: <em>"Celebrating Sexuality is a one of a kind boutique festival, for the exploration of sex and relationships.  Held on the Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, Australia; we unite the tribes of contemporary sexuality across 4 workshop spaces.  </em>

<em>​With a personal touch evident across every aspect of the weekend, in an atmosphere characterised by exploration and intimacy, this festival has become one of the Australia’s most beloved over the course of its 6-year history." </em>

Both "SENSUAL ORCHESTRATION: SCENING AND CONNECTING WITH SENSATION PLAY" and "IT'S NOT ALL ORGIES: A REALISTIC CONVERSATION ABOUT POLYAMORY AND OPEN-RELATIONSHIPS" have been selected for this years programme and I am honored to presenting alongside so many amazing educators (including <a href="http://www.celebratingsexuality.com/2017-presenters/sinclair-smith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sinclair Sexsmith</a>, one of my sex ed idols!) and to have my beloved <a href="https://twitter.com/missdaisyadair" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Daisy Adair</a> by my side to PA/TA/make sure I don't die trying to put up a tent.
