<strong>Review-Specific<br>
</strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vulva</span>: Reasonably high clitoral positioning, clitoral hood isn't prominent, quite long clitoral stem allowing for a degree of movement, internal labia longer than external, very multi-orgasmic but can require a short refractory period<br><br>
<em>Preferences: </em>Not a fan of direct clit stimulation, prefer rumble over buzz, patterns do little for me, very responsive to pressure rather than rubbing, I can get myself off easily manually when I don't have fake nails, adore suction toys, external stimulation is not required for orgasms, 2 O'Clock is Magical

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Vagina</span>: Very grabby PC muscles, especially during orgasm, very prominent g-spot, a-spot accessible by digital stimulation and very intense, comfortable depth varies a lot, can handle width better than depth<br><br>
<em>Preferences: </em>Internal vibrations don't do a lot unless combined with external stimulation, consistent g-spot stimulation reliably leads to very quick orgasms (usually accompanied by squirting), love fisting but very dependent on knuckle width, very very multi-orgasmic with zero refractory

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Anal</span>: Is a butt? Can take a lot after short but targeted warm up, very very multi-orgasmic, don't partake as much as I'd like as I'm very finicky about prep and time/logistics don't always allow<br><br>
<em>Preferences:</em> Dildos or moving penetration over plugs though I'm getting better with plugs as time goes on

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Nipples</span>: Both pierced (horizontal bars), good sensitive, very orgasmic from pain or oral stimulation, slight refractory from nipple orgasms required<br><br>
<em>Preferences: </em>Love clamps but sensitivity means removal after a longer time period can move into 'bad pain' territory

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Kink</span>: Super Kinky. Switchy as hell, a Sadistic/Sensation Domme when I top and primarily a physical/sexual/emotional masochist when I bottom though I have experience with very intense submission in the context of a D/s relationship, 5+ years of public scene experience and longer in private, casual professional domme work, freelance kink educator since 2014, mark and bruise quiet easily, high pain tolerance with warm up<br><br>
<em>Interests: </em>Sensation Play is always #1, most sadomasochism, role play in general, humiliation and degradation, exhibitionism, blood/medical play, pony play, service play (mainly receiving), gags/oral fixation, femininity, objectification , rope switching, ritual, rough body play, Nylon (particularly hosiery), Latex, Extreme Heels<br><br>
<em>Preference:</em> (keeping it gear specific) High quality is vital, small companies or bespoke where possible, will always invest in quality, prefer canes/paddles/straps/crops to floggers and whips but very comfortable with both, prefer stingy to thuddy but need thuddier for warm up currently, always jute rope (currently use lightly treated Tossa Jute from Jade rope but looking to purchase a more traditional set), as body safe as is physically possible
